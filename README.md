# PowerSync Swift

The PowerSync Swift SDK is an extension of the [PowerSync Kotlin Multiplatform SDK](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin), and uses the API tool [SKIE](https://skie.touchlab.co/) and KMMBridge to generate and publish a native Swift SDK. More details about this configuration can be found in our blog [here](https://www.powersync.com/blog/using-kotlin-multiplatform-with-kmmbridge-and-skie-to-publish-a-native-swift-sdk).

The SDK reference for the PowerSync Swift SDK is available [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/swift).

## Alpha Release

This SDK is currently in an alpha release and not suitable for production use, unless you have tested your use case(s) extensively. Breaking changes are still likely to occur.
