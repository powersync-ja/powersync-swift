_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps with instantly-responsive UI/UX and simplified state transfer. Syncs between SQLite on the client-side and Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL on the server-side._

# PowerSync Swift

This is the PowerSync SDK for Swift clients. The SDK reference is available [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/swift), API references are [documented here](https://powersync-ja.github.io/powersync-swift/documentation/powersync/).

## Available Products

The SDK provides two main products:

- **PowerSync**: Core SDK with SQLite support for data synchronization.
- **PowerSyncDynamic**: Forced dynamically linked version of `PowerSync` - useful for XCode previews.
- **PowerSyncGRDB [ALPHA]**: GRDB integration allowing PowerSync to work with GRDB databases. This product is currently in an alpha release.

## Demo Apps / Example Projects

The easiest way to test the PowerSync Swift SDK is to run our demo application.

- [Demo/PowerSyncExample](./Demo/README.md): A simple to-do list application demonstrating the use of the PowerSync Swift SDK using a Supabase connector.

## Installation

Add

```swift
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-swift", from: "1.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: [
                ...
                .product(
                    name: "PowerSync",
                    package: "powersync-swift"
                ),
                // Optional: Add if using GRDB
                .product(
                    name: "PowerSyncGRDB",
                    package: "powersync-swift"
                )
            ]
        )
    ]
```

to your `Package.swift` file.

## Usage

### Basic PowerSync Setup

```swift
import PowerSync

let mySchema = Schema(
    tables: [
        Table(
            name: "users",
            columns: [
                .text("count"),
                .integer("is_active"),
                .real("weight"),
                .text("description")
            ]
        )
    ]
)

let powerSync = PowerSyncDatabase(
    schema: mySchema,
    logger: DefaultLogger(minSeverity: .debug)
)
```

### GRDB Integration

If you're using [GRDB.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) by [Gwendal Roué](https://github.com/groue), you can integrate PowerSync with your existing database. Special thanks to Gwendal for their help in developing this integration.

**⚠️ Note:** The GRDB integration is currently in **alpha** release and the API may change significantly. While functional, it should be used with caution in production environments.

```swift
import PowerSync
import PowerSyncGRDB
import GRDB

// Configure GRDB with PowerSync support
var config = Configuration()
config.configurePowerSync(schema: mySchema)

// Create database with PowerSync enabled
let dbPool = try DatabasePool(
    path: dbPath,
    configuration: config
)

let powerSync = try openPowerSyncWithGRDB(
    pool: dbPool,
    schema: mySchema,
    identifier: "app-db"
)
```

## Underlying Kotlin Dependency

The PowerSync Swift SDK makes use of the [PowerSync Kotlin Multiplatform SDK](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync-kotlin) and the API tool [SKIE](https://skie.touchlab.co/) under the hood to implement the Swift package.
However, this dependency is resolved internally and all public APIs are written entirely in Swift.

For more details, see the [Swift SDK reference](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/swift) and generated [API references](https://powersync-ja.github.io/powersync-swift/documentation/powersync/).

## Attachments

See the attachments [README](./Sources/PowerSync/attachments/README.md) for more information.

## XCode Previews

XCode previews currently fail to load in a reasonable time after adding PowerSync to an XCode project. XCode requires dynamic linking for previews. This is enabled by enabling `ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB` in the XCode project. It seems like the previews fail to load due to PowerSync providing a `binaryTarget` which is linked statically by default.

XCode previews can be enabled by either:

Enabling `Editor -> Canvas -> Use Legacy Previews Execution` in XCode.

Or adding the `PowerSyncDynamic` product when adding PowerSync to your project. This product will assert that PowerSync should be dynamically linked, which restores XCode previews.
